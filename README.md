# Cervical_Cancer_Predection

In this study, an XG-Boost classifier was constructed and trained to determine a person's risk of developing cervical cancer. 858 patients at the "Hospital Universitario de Caracas" in Caracas, Venezuela, provided data on a variety of topics, including the number of pregnancies, smoking habits, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), demographics, and previous medical histories. Using the training data set, do exploratory data analysis and data visualisation. Before training the model, the data were prepared and divided into training and test datasets. The XG-Boost-Algorithm was trained and tested for this challenge in Python using the sci-kit module. This machine learning model's accuracy was determined to be: 
-99.708 % (Training Dataset) 
-95.348 % (Test Dataset)
